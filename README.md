My motto : Living in the world, I just want to understand some truth and meet something interesting.

I am so glad to join in the big family of GitHub.

And I would like to share something interesting with you such as new knowledge I learnt or thoughts about books,movies and etc..

Wish all of us can realize our dreams and be the one we want to be.
